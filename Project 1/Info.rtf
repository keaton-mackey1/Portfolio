\'97 Project 1 is a project from a data analytics class in my junior year at college. This project was freeform. My decision was to create a Python script that would clean and aggregate and perform key analytics without needing to manipulate a script. This need arose from my lab work where we would have excels of over 40,000 rows, including data from 40,000 subjects and wanting to perform key analytics in the click of a button. I made a graphic user interface in order to receive analytics in real time. The analytics that we installed were t-test, plots, and side by side viewing. }
